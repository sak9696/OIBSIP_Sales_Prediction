# 📊 Sales Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting product sales based on advertising expenditure using Machine Learning techniques.  
The model analyzes how different advertising channels influence sales and predicts future sales values accordingly.

This project was completed as part of the **Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship**, fulfilling all assigned requirements and extending beyond them with advanced regression techniques and business insights.
